urls = {     "get": "https://httpbin.org/get?t=learn+python+programming",     "headers": "https://httpbin.org/headers",     "ip": "https://httpbin.org/ip",     "user-agent": "https://httpbin.org/user-agent",     "UUID": "https://httpbin.org/uuid",     "JSON": "https://httpbin.org/json", } def get_content(title, url):     resp = requests.get(url)     print(f"Response for {title}")     print(resp.json()) for title, url in urls.items():     get_content(title, url)     print("-" * 40) The preceding snippet should be straightforward. We declare a dictionary of URLs against which we want to perform HTTP requests. We have encapsulated the code that performs the request into the get_content() function. As you can see, we perform a GET request (by using requests.get()), and we print the title and the JSON-decoded version of the body of the response. Let us spend a few words on this last bit.
